You likely want to integrate GridTest into your favorite continuous integration
(CI) service and there are many good ways to do that.

## GridTest Linting

If you add a new function to your testing library, you probably
want to ensure that you've written a test for it. Akin to black for code
formatting, gridtest provides a gridtest check command
to check if a file has all tests written. In the case that all functions
are represented, the return code is 0 (and the CI will pass):

```bash
$ gridtest check tests/modules/temp-tests.yml 

No new tests to add!‚ú® ü•ëÔ∏è ‚ú®

# Return code is 0
$ echo $?
0
```

But now let's say that we update the module associated with the testing file
and add a new function.

```python
def new_function():
    print("No test for me!")
```

And then we run checks again:


```bash
$ gridtest check tests/modules/temp-tests.yml 

New sections to add:
tests.modules.temp.new_function
```

Since we have a new test (and missed it) the return code is exit with an error (1):

```bash
echo $?
1
```

If we wanted to skip this test, we could do that by defining a skip pattern:

```bash
$ gridtest check tests/modules/temp-tests.yml --skip-patterns new_function

No new tests to add!‚ú® ü•ëÔ∏è ‚ú®
```

And the return code is again 0 (meaning it would pass in CI).

```bash
$ echo $?
0
```

## Continuous Integration Recipes

Gridtest will have templates added soon for particular continuous integration
provides. Generally, you can use the above `gridest check <testfile>.yml`
to check for needing to write tests, and then the standard grid runner
(with any options you need) to run the tests, after installing gridtest.
For example, in a run statement you might do:

```bash
pip install gridtest
gridtest run testfile.yml
```

We will have more examples coming shortly!
